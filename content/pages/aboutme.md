<h2>More information about me</h2>
</p>




My path into technology was sparked during a challenging time using learning as a creative escape. What started with exploring Linux and scripting soon blossomed into a love for infrastructure and automation. Since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering tools and workflows that simplify complex systems and empower teams to deliver software reliably.

### What I Do Daily

- Collaborating with engineering teams to **design and manage scalable infrastructure**  
- Automating workflows using **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **CI/CD pipelines**  
- Enhancing observability with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and log management tools like **ELK/Zabbix**  
- Constantly experimenting beyond work hours: building personal tools, learning new technologies, or hitting the gym  

I particularly enjoy **streamlining processes**, troubleshooting technical issues, and sharing knowledge through blog posts.
