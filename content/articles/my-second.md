Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are the **backbone of modern DevOps workflows**. They ensure code moves from development to production **faster, safer, and with fewer errors**.  

Here are some **best practices for CI/CD pipelines**:  

1. **Automate Everything**  
   - From building, testing, and linting code to deployment, automation reduces human error and speeds up delivery.  

2. **Keep Pipelines Fast**  
   - Use caching, parallel builds, and containerized test environments so developers get feedback quickly.  

3. **Shift Security Left**  
   - Integrate tools like **Checkov, Trivy, or Snyk** into your pipelines to catch vulnerabilities early.  

4. **Test at Every Stage**  
   - Run **unit, integration, and end-to-end tests** to validate applications before production.  

5. **Use Feature Flags**  
   - Deploy new features behind flags to test in production without affecting all users.  

6. **Implement Rollback Strategies**  
   - Blue-Green or Canary deployments allow **safe rollbacks** in case something goes wrong.  

7. **Monitor and Alert**  
   - Integrate **Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK** with pipelines for real-time monitoring and quick incident response.
