Summary: Level up your Terraform workflow with five practical Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices that improve readability, security, and maintainability.

Terraform isn’t just about “making it work.”  
It’s about making it **readable, secure, and easy to maintain** so your future self (and your team) will thank you.  

Here’s how to level up your Terraform game ⬇️

---

### 1️⃣ Format Everything – `terraform fmt`
- ✅ Keep code consistent across the team  
- ✅ Avoid “looks different on my machine” problems  
- 📎 [Docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/fmt)

---

### 2️⃣ Validate Before You Deploy – `terraform validate`
- ✅ Catch errors early  
- ✅ Avoid shipping broken infra to prod  
- 📎 [Docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/validate)

---

### 3️⃣ Lint for Best Practices – `tflint`
- ✅ Spot typos & deprecated arguments  
- ✅ Fix issues before they bite you  
- 📎 [Docs](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)

---

### 4️⃣ Scan for Security – **Checkov**
- ✅ Find risky configs (public S3, open SGs)  
- ✅ Stay compliant (CIS, PCI, HIPAA)  
- 📎 [Checkov Docs](https://www.checkov.io/)

---

### 5️⃣ Auto-Generate Docs – `terraform-docs`
- ✅ Keep README in sync with your code  
- ✅ Save time on manual updates  
- 📎 [Docs](https://terraform-docs.io/)

---

💡 **Pro Tip:** Add these checks to your **CI/CD pipeline** so they run on every PR.  

Infrastructure is more than code — it’s a living system.  
Keep it clear, secure, and reliable.
